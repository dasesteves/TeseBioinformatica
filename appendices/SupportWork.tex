\chapter{Support Work}
\label{app:support_work}

This appendix consolidates auxiliary materials that support the main text but would otherwise interrupt its flow. It includes scripts, data dictionaries, interface notes and training aids referenced in the analysis (docs/ and tmp\_ai\_reports/).

\section{Data Extraction and Analysis Aids}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Legacy data field inventories for prescriptions, validations, administrations, and stock movements (structure only; no counts). Source: institutional docs and tmp\_ai\_reports.
    \item Example request/response shapes for legacy APIs or export views when applicable (anonymized).
    \item Notes on data reconciliation steps used to construct baseline snapshots.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interface and Integration Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication/authorization configuration checklists (LDAP/\gls{sso}, \gls{jwt}).
    \item Integration touchpoints considered (billing, reporting, national platforms) with interface placeholders to be filled when available.
    \item Error handling and audit logging conventions adopted in the artefact.
\end{itemize}

\section{Training and Change Management Aids}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Role-specific quick reference guides (to be populated): prescriber, pharmacist, nurse.
    \item Sprint feedback form templates and issue triage workflows.
    \item Communication plan outline and champion responsibilities.
\end{itemize}
