\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Context and Problem Definition}

Medication management is a high-stakes, complex process central to modern healthcare delivery. Its successful execution is critical for patient safety, yet it remains a major source of preventable adverse events. The landmark report "To Err is Human" by the Institute of Medicine brought global attention to the prevalence of medical errors, identifying them as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality \cite{kohn2000}. Subsequent research and initiatives by the World Health Organization have reinforced this reality, indicating that medication-related harm affects one in ten patients globally and that the associated costs are substantial \cite{who2017, who2022}.

A primary contributing factor to this problem is the fragmented nature of Health Information Technology (\gls{hit}) ecosystems within hospitals \cite{berwick2008}. Many healthcare institutions operate on a patchwork of legacy systems, often developed decades apart using disparate technologies \cite{kazemi2016}. This technological heterogeneity creates significant barriers to interoperability, resulting in information silos where critical patient data is not shared effectively between departments or professionals. This fragmentation directly undermines continuity of care and has been identified as a key threat to patient safety \cite{ash2004, keasberry2017}. The workflow, which should be a seamless continuum from a physician's prescription to pharmaceutical validation and finally to nursing administration, is often interrupted by manual processes, verbal communications, and data re-entry, each step introducing a new opportunity for error.

The Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Vila Verde (\gls{scmvv}) serves as a representative case study for these systemic challenges. Its core operations rely on the \gls{aida}, a legacy system with significant limitations, including a non-intuitive interface, a lack of real-time clinical decision support (e.g., for drug interactions), and poor integration capabilities \cite{moss2015, bowles2020}. This environment compromises patient safety and hampers operational efficiency. This dissertation addresses these issues by detailing the design, development, and implementation of a modern, integrated medication management system aimed at creating a cohesive, safe, and efficient clinical workflow.

\section{Objectives and Dissertation Structure}

The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate an integrated medication management system that optimizes the prescription, validation, dispensing, and administration processes at the SCMVV, thereby enhancing patient safety and operational efficiency. To achieve this, a set of specific scientific and technological objectives was defined. Scientifically, the aim was to analyze the system's impact on medication error rates, evaluate its effect on clinical workflow efficiency, and assess its usability and acceptance among clinical staff. Technologically, the objectives were to design a scalable microservices architecture, develop a robust clinical decision support engine, create an intuitive user interface using modern web technologies, ensure seamless integration with legacy systems, and establish a comprehensive audit trail for all medication-related activities \cite{belle2013, misra2023, mandl2020, european2016}.

This dissertation is organized to logically present the research journey. Following this introduction, Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of the State of the Art, including point-of-care administration (eMAR/BCMA) and process standardization in healthcare (Sections~\ref{sec:emar_bcma} and~\ref{sec:process_standardization}), as well as the national context (Section~\ref{sec:national_context_portugal}). Chapter 3 describes the in-depth research Methodology, including the architectural choices and evaluation strategies. Chapter 4 outlines the Work Plan, detailing the project's timeline and phases. Chapter 5 details the Expected Results and Evaluation Plan. Chapter 6 presents Results obtained to date. Chapter 7 offers a Discussion of these results, contextualizing them within the broader literature. Finally, Chapter 8 provides the Conclusion and Future Work, summarizing the contributions and proposing directions ahead. 

\section{Current Context at SCMVV}
\label{sec:context_scmvv}

To address identified gaps in the contextualization of the case study, this section documents the current medication-management processes and supporting information systems at the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Vila Verde (\gls{scmvv}). The intent is to provide a concrete baseline that motivates the proposed solution and frames subsequent evaluation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Systems in use and their roles (e.g., \gls{aida}\,/AIDA-PCE; possible interactions with hospital HIS such as SONHO; national platforms such as \gls{pem}), within the scope of medication management.
    \item End-to-end workflow as practiced today: physician prescription, pharmaceutical validation, stock/dispensing, and nursing administration, highlighting where manual steps or data re-entry occur.
    \item Known integration gaps and failure points affecting continuity of care (e.g., absence of real-time decision support or cross-module synchronization).
    \item Baseline indicators to be captured where available (e.g., error types, volumes of movements for controlled substances, turnaround times), to support before/after reasoning.
\end{itemize}

\section{As-is System Architecture (SCMVV)}
\label{sec:as_is_architecture}

This section outlines a high-level description of the current (as-is) technical architecture supporting medication management at \gls{scmvv}, to contrast later with the target architecture. The description will enumerate principal modules, databases, interfaces, and data flows relevant to prescription, validation, dispensing, and administration, and will explicitly indicate where interfaces or interoperability are absent or manual.

\section{Current Medication Process Organization at SCMVV}
\label{sec:current_process_org}

This section documents the organizational perspective of the medication process at \gls{scmvv}, complementing the technical as-is view. It focuses on roles, handoffs, and standard operating procedures as practiced today, highlighting opportunities for standardization.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Roles and responsibilities across disciplines: prescribing physicians, hospital pharmacists (validation and stock management), and nursing staff (administration and recording).
    \item Artefacts (main actual artefact is a legacy artefact in a vb.net project (AIDA-PCE)) and records in use (systems and/or paper forms) at each stage, and where transcriptions or verbal confirmations occur.
    \item Typical handoffs between departments, including triggers (e.g., a prescription becomes available for validation) and feedback loops.
    \item Known variability across wards/services and its impact on consistency and safety.
    \item Pointers to figures/diagrams: process flow diagram of the current cycle; swimlane diagram of cross-role interactions; inventory of current forms/screens.
\end{itemize}
